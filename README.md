# Watcher of Friends Online

The script asks user's login and password at vk.com, then outputs a list of user's friends being online at the moment.

# How to Install

Python 3 should be already installed. Then use pip (or pip3 if there is a conflict with old Python 2 setup) to install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt # alternatively try pip3
```

Remember, it is recommended to use [virtualenv/venv](https://devman.org/encyclopedia/pip/pip_virtualenv/) for better isolation.

# Quickstart

Example of script launch on Linux, Python 3.5:

```bash
python3 vk_friends_online
```

Output example as following:

```
Friends online:
Ivan Ivanov
```

# Project Goals

The code is written for educational purposes. Training course for web-developers - [DEVMAN.org](https://devman.org)
